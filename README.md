## How Indie-Bytes Works

Indie-Bytes leverages a combination of JavaScript and JSON data to provide you with a tailored snack recipe experience. Here's a high-level overview of how the code functions:

1. **Loading Recipe Data**:
   - When you visit Indie-Bytes, the code fetches a JSON file named 'recipes.json' that contains a collection of snack recipes. These recipes include details such as name, ingredients, calories, and cooking time. This JSON data serves as the foundation for our snack recommendations.

2. **Ingredient Selection**:
   - You'll notice a list of checkboxes on our website, each representing a different ingredient. As a user, you can select the ingredients you have available by simply checking the corresponding boxes.

3. **Dynamic Filtering**:
   - As you select and deselect ingredients, our JavaScript code dynamically filters the recipes based on your choices. It identifies recipes that can be prepared with the ingredients you've selected.

4. **Recipe Presentation**:
   - Upon clicking the "Find Recipes" button, the code displays the top three matching recipes. For each of these recipes, you'll see the name, calories, and cooking time, making it easy to choose the perfect snack to satisfy your cravings.

This seamless integration of JavaScript and JSON data ensures that Indie-Bytes offers you snack recipes that are not only delicious but also feasible with the ingredients you have at hand.
